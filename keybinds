Small hands or large, the key is having everything EASILY in reach of where your fingers and movement keys are. -For standard ASD movement there are eight buttons immediately next to the A,S,D keys, and '1' and '4' are the 9th and 10th that are basically right there. Q,E,F,1,2,3,4,Z,X,C

Bind your most often used, most important abilities to these 10. your pinky finger should be/is resting on Shift, when your fingers are at rest on A,S,D.

So now you have 10 more keys that are also immediately within reach, just by adding the shift modifier.

If there are anymore keys you need Ctrl is almost as good and adds the 21st through 30th keybinds.

GL

my general keybinds are:

` (key next to 1), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

q, e, r, x

f1, f2, f3, f4

shift + 1/2/3/4

shift + q/e/r/x/c

shift + f1/f2/f3/f4

alt + c, x

just use keybinds that you can reach easily and then get used to using them.
